                    ## Overview

                    Write an article that engages the reader, and communicates problems and solutions in a clear and concise manner.


                    ## Format your documentation content

                    Use Markdown to provide structure and style to your documentation. DocC features a tailored variant of Markdown known as _documentation markup_, which expands upon Markdown's syntax by introducing features such enhanced image support, term lists, and asides. To maintain uniformity in both structure and style, it is recommended to employ DocC's documentation markup for all your written documentation.

                    To learn more about how to format your documentation please refer to [Formatting Your Documentation Content](https://www.swift.org/documentation/docc/formatting-your-documentation-content) in the DocC documentation.

                    ## Customizing the Appearance of Your Documentation Pages

                    By default, rendered documentation webpages produced by DocC come with a default visual styling. If you wish, you may make adjustments to this styling by adding an optional theme-settings.json file to the root of your documentation catalog with some configuration. This file is used to customize various things like colors and fonts. You can even make changes to the way that specific elements appear, like buttons, code listings, and asides. Additionally, some metadata for the website can be configured in this file, and it can also be used to opt in or opt out of certain default rendering behavior.

                    To learn more about this please visit [Customizing the Appearance of Your Documentation Pages](https://www.swift.org/documentation/docc/customizing-the-appearance-of-your-documentation-pages) in the DocC documentation.
